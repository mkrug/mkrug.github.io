Dear friends

On 13th of July Ruby.mk turns five! 

It's been exciting five years of Ruby.mk. We held install fests, lots of meetups, presetations, Rails Girls and so on. Our next goal is to celebrate those 5 years as best as we can. Therefore, we are organizing a drinkup!

The drinkup will be held on 13th of July in [Porta Pub (Bunjakovec)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pub+Porta/@41.997701,21.424691,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x1354144b7fe0e6dd:0x40c04af622606161). Starting time: 20:00h.

Oh,  we'll be watching the World Cup final too! So, you can expect lots of beer, cheering and of course, praising of Ruby's awesomeness.

See you there!
