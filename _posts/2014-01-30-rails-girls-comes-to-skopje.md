Rails Girls is a workshop that aims to give women the knowledge and tools to build their ideas! 

The workshop is an opportunity for women to build an application using Ruby on Rails. The students will learn the wonderful language Ruby and using Ruby on Rails, they'll have a working application up and running during the course of a single day. Isn't that exciting?!

The Rails Girls workshop will be open to all women who are interested in learning how to program.You don’t have to have any experience. All you need is a laptop that is capable of running the latest version of Ruby on Rails.
We will provide the space and the coaches, we’ll also provide food and drinks so you can stay focused on learning. Also, at the end there will be some rewards ;)

The number of students that can participate is limited, so we are asking everyone to fill out [an application for the workshop](https://railsgirlsmacedonia.wufoo.com/forms/railsgirls-application-skopje-2014/). The event will be held on 11th & 12th of April 2014 in [Media Lab's office](http://goo.gl/maps/LJ4ZZ).
