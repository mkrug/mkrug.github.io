Time & Place: 20.12.2012, 7pm - 9pm at Hacklab KIKA

We will present how to build a web framework wtih Ruby and walk through the source code of [kreator](https://github.com/dalibor/kreator "Kreator web framework"). Kreator is a small MVC web framework build to demonstrate the basic concepts of Ruby on Rails, and generally any MVC web framework from the bottom-up perspective.

We'll start with a simple Rack ( [Ruby Webserver Interface](http://rack.github.com/ "Ruby Webserver Interface")) application. Then we will continue by introducing the basic concepts of web applications such as router, cookies and input params. We'll see what are Rakefile and Gemfile and how to test applications written with this library. In the end we'll write SQLite model adapter, see how templates rendering works and end up with full [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller "Model-view-controller") architecture.
