New Ruby meetup this Thursday (25.09.2014), starting 7pm at Hacklab KIKA.

We'll have only one presentation, [Vlatko Trajkov](https://github.com/trajkovvlatko "Vlatko Trajkov") will compare the popular Ruby tools for background processing: [Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque "Resque"), [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq "Sidekiq"), [Delayed Job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job "Delayed Job").

The rest of the time we'll use for discussion. If you work or have interest in Ruby, come join us and feel free to ask any questions about Ruby tools, projects, etc.
