Date and place: 31st July, 7pm - 9pm, Hacklab KIKA.

### TDD: Why, When and How

Ile Eftimov will present on how to test Ruby and Rails applications, some overview of best practices, and a general discussion about testing production code.

### **Ruby tracing tool with Vim integration**

Dalibor Nasevic will present a simple DIY tool for tracing Ruby code execution. When you get lost with a debugger wondering to step or go next is when this tool comes in handy. It is quick and dirty integration between Ruby TracePoint and a bit of vimscript.
