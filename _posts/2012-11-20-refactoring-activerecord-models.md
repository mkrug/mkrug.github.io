Time & Place: 22.11.2012, 7pm - 9pm at Hacklab KIKA

In this presentation  [Dalibor Nasevic](http://twitter.com/dnasevic "Dalibor Nasevic") will talk about common anti-patterns in ActiveRecord models and different ways to refactor them. We'll see how to improve the quality of a Rails application by applying basic principles of Object Oriented design like Decoupling, The Law of Demeter, Single responsibility principle, etc.

We'll also learn how to avoid fat ActiveRecord models, when to use model callbacks and why nested model attributes are not as good idea as advertised.
