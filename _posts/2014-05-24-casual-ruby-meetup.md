We'll do a casual ruby meetup on Thursday 29th of May.

The plan is to share experience, have conversation about Ruby and similar things. If there is interest we could do a Coding Dojo or Code Kata. Or if someone wants to present anything, we'll be happy to see it.  

Date and place: 29th May, 7pm - 9pm, [Siyelo](http://siyelo.com/ "Siyelo") ( [map](http://goo.gl/hpFPLC "Siyelo location")).
