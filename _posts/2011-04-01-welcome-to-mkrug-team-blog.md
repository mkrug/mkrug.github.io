    puts "Welcome to MKRUG team blog!"

As you can notice, we now have a team blog application written in Ruby on Rails and we will use it for announcing our meetings and writing Ruby related posts. If you want to be an editor, please write me an email at dalibor.nasevic gmail com.

You can write on the blog in whatever language you want (English, Macedonian or something else!? Japanese maybe!?), we all have Google Translate and will probably understand what you are saying.

You can also read the source code of this application at [Github](https://github.com/dalibor/ruby.mk "Source code of ruby.mk at Github ") and contribute to it if you have some ideas or you have better colors to improve the design.

This application will also be a starting point for one of the projects at the local [Summer of Code](http://bugs.spodeli.org/issues/70 "Summer of Code") (if it happens!?), see the discussions on the [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/mk-ruby-users-group/browse_thread/thread/e64a848ef05957a2 "Local summer of code discussion at MKRUG Google Group") if you are interested.

If you haven't done it already, join our [Google Group mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/mk-ruby-users-group/ "MKRUG Google Group Mailing List"), follow us on Twitter [@mk\_rug](https://twitter.com/mk_rug "MKRUG Twitter") and add our [RSS feed](http://ruby.mk/posts.rss "MKRUG RSS feed") to your RSS reader.

See you at the next MKRUG meeting.
