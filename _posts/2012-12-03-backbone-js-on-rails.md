In this presentation [Peco Danajlovski](http://twitter.com/vortexdnr "Peco Danajlovski") will introduce you to Backbone.js and how to use it with Ruby on Rails web framework to build complex user interfaces.

[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/ "Backbone.js") is a light Javascript library based on MFC architecture that will help you stop writing javascript spaghetti. It was originally extracted from a Rails application ( [Document Cloud](http://www.documentcloud.org/home "Document Cloud")), which means it's easy to integrate it with Rails.

Peco will also explain how to create JSON APIs in Rails and connect client-side (Backbone) Models to sync with them. He'll use CoffeeScript to write Javascript. And, he'll also talk about RABL (Ruby API Builder Language), a templating system for generating JSON, XML and other data formats.
